# Github-Username-Helper

Quickly generate a list of available 1 word usernames for your github account.


To use:

1.) Run GithubUsernameListMaker

2.) Wait for 100 words to be added to usernameSelection

3.) Find a name you like

4.) Change username at https://github.com/settings/admin


Note: Not all names generated with this list will work. Github purposely doesn't allow certain words and there may be other reasons why the name won't work. This tool simply checks if the username is currently being used or not.
