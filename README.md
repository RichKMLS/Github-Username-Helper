# Github-Username-Helper

#### Quickly generate a list of available 1 word usernames for your github account.


#####  How to use:

      0.) Save a list of words to 'wordlist'

      1.) Run GithubUsernameListMaker

      2.) Wait for 100 words to be added to usernameSelection

      3.) Find a name you like

      4.) Change username at https://github.com/settings/admin

#

Notes: 

- Not all names generated with this list will work. Github purposely doesn't allow certain words and there may be other reasons why the name won't work. This tool simply checks if the username is currently being used or not.

- This does not come with a prefilled list of words. Though many word lists can easily be located on Github.
